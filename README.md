# Digisaur
The Discord-integrated cooperative workshift system built for Davisaurs, by Davisaurs.

## Philosophy
The workshift website is old, sluggish, and doesn't translate to most co-opers' technological sensibilities. The purpose of Digisaur is to provide a Discord interface for workshift management, because most houses are on Discord and most co-opers are very comfortable with Discord's interface.

## How to Use
Currently, Digisaur is in a very unstable state. Once the bot is considered stable, I will write a guide as to how to use it in your own houses!

As a warning, this bot is not built to be centrally hosted to manage multiple houses' workshift tracking at once. Rather, it is meant to live on a server in your house's network closet as a self-hosted solution. Much workshift information is sensitive, and my personal philosophy is that sensitive information should live on servers managed solely by members of the house. As such, if you're a workshift manager looking to implement a system like this, please contact your network manager for more information!
